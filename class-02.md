#Chapter 2: text

*When creating a web page, you add tags(known as markup) to the contents of the page.

  -Structual markup: the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs
  -Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quatation(who said it), the meaning of acronyms,and so on.

*HEADINGS
  -html has six "levels" of headings
  <h1>this is the main heading</h1>
  <h2>this is a level 2 heading</h2>
  <h3>this is a level 3 heading</h3>
  <h4>this is a level 4 heading</h4>
  <h5>this is a level 5 heading</h5>
  <h6>this is a level 6 heading</h6>

*PARAGRAPHS
  -to create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with a opening(<p>) tag and a closing (</p>) tag.

*BOLD&ITALIC
  -by enclosing words in (<b>)&(</b>) tags we can make them bold.
  -by enclosing words in (<i>)&(</i>) tags we can make words appear italic.

*SUPERSCRIPT&SUBSCRIPT
  - the (<sup>) element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power.
  - the (<sub>) element is used to contain characters that should subscript. It's commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas
